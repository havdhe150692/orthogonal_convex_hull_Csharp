# Orthogonal Convex Hull/ C# #
Group Assignment for MAD101, FPT University: Orthogonal Convex Hull

------------

This is a program made for drawing the Orthogonal Convex Hull of the 100 randomly-generated points within a given-sized box.

# Tech

Written in C#.
IDE Visual Studio Preview 2019 (recommended if you want to change the size of WinForm)

# Version
## 1.00

First attempt of uploading the source code to GitHub.

Using self-made algorithm.

**Works perfectly in general cases. Under developement for special cases and for fitting the definition from* On the Definition and Computation of Rectilinear Convex Hulls, Thomas Ottmann (1984)* **

To see the source code, open Form1.cs file in every editor or click the Form1.cs file in Visual Studio and press F7. This is the place where all the algorithm stays. Program.cs is computer-generated file to make the WinForm works. OrthogonalObject.cs is an unused class. There is also a lot of unsused code in Form1.cs, for further development. Simply ignore it.
